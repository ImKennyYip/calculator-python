## Homework:
You can continue working on this project if you like. You can implement the missing click handler for the squareroot button. In addition you can expand the number of buttons to include scientific calculations with sin, cos, tan, log, etc. You can also add a delete button to remove a digit at a time as opposed to clear all, and other functions such as absolute value, power, remainder, etc.
